# Player Statues #

## About ##
The Player Statue is a block you can place down which looks like a little player, if it has no player name attached it'll take the skin of the user that placed them. You can rename the Player Statue in an anvil to attach a username (Shift clicking does not work).

If you right-click your Player Statue with Phantom membrane it'll become a bigger variant which behaves like an armor stand with the ability to pose them, perfect to make your Minecraft worlds feel more alive.

This mod is a standalone version of the Player Statue feature from [Statues](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/statues).
